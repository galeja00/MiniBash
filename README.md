# MiniShell

Mysh is a simple shell that executes commands with arguments. The syntax of this shell is as follows:

Commands and their arguments can consist of any sequence of characters except for space, tab, newline, semicolon, and double ampersand.
The name of the command and its arguments are separated by at least one white space, which can be either a space or a tab character.
Commands are separated from each other by newline, semicolon, or double ampersand. When using semicolon or double ampersand, there must be at least one white space before and after the separator.

Mysh can be executed by running the following command:

<code>mysh input_file</code>
